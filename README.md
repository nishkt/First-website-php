# First-website-php
This is a basic website that was hosted on my local server via xampp implementing MySQL database tables, php code, and front-end web development tools. 

The website displays information on my hometown of Kobe, Japan. There are 4 database tables, which includes a table for users, a table for comments, a table for flight details that gets emailed to the user, and a table used for the contact form.

There are 9 php files under the following names:
1. mainpage.php

This file contains the html content for the website. It includes some php code for viewing the login inputs. It also uses php to show if a user is signed in or not through starting a session.
